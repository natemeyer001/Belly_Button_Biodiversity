# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview
Used JavaScript and HTML to diplay a dynamic page with multiple charts. Created a filter for each id that refreshes the page with their data once selected. The filter ids were created with a forEach call instead of hard-coding individually. The gauge chart just shows the weekly amount of belly button washes. The bar chart and the bubble chart both display the count of the bacteria and the names when you hover over them.
